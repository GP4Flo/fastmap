                              Exhibit A
                        Application Requirements

   1. APIs and Functionality.

      (a) Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner prescribed by KAI
          and must not use or call any private APIs.

      (b) An Application may not itself install or launch other executable code by
          any means, including without limitation through the use of a plug-in architecture,
          calling other frameworks, other APIs or otherwise. No interpreted code may
          be downloaded or used in an Application except for code that is interpreted
          and run by KAI’s Documented APIs and built-in interpreter(s).

      (c) Without KAI’s prior written approval, an Application may not provide, unlock
          or enable additional features or functionality through distribution mechanisms
          other than KaiOS Store.

      (d) An Application may only read data from or write data to an Application’s
          designated container area on the device, except as otherwise specified by KAI.

      (e) Required API implementations. All Applications must implement the following
          APIs as soon as they are made available to Licensee by KAI and in any
          event within three (3) months from the date when KAI has notified the
          Licensee by email.

          (i)   Payment/Billing API. All payment processing functionalities in the
                Application (in-app purchases, subscriptions, purchase of goods/services
                and alike) must be implemented solely using the payment API provided
                by KAI, and must use KAI’s branding and UI elements as specified in
                the applicable Documentation. Use of other payment APIs in the Application
                is prohibited.

          (ii)  Advertisement API. Advertisement API enables Applications to display
                advertisements to the user. Use of other advertisement APIs in the
                Application is prohibited.

          (iii) Analytics API. Analytics API is used to collect metrics from the
                Applications (e.g. which applications have been downloaded, which
                applications are used, how often, how long). Use of other analytics
                APIs in the Application is prohibited.

          (iv)  Kai Account API. Kai Account API is used to identify the user
                account. Use of other accounts in the Application is prohibited.

   2. User Interfaces and Data.

      (a) Applications must comply with the Documentation provided by KAI.

      (b) Any form of user or device data collection, or image, picture or voice
          capture or recording performed by the Application (collectively “Recordings”),
          and any form of user data, content or information processing, maintenance,
          uploading, syncing, or transmission performed by the Application
          (collectively “Transmissions”) must declare to KAI and comply with all
          applicable privacy laws and regulations as well as any requirements from
          KAI’s privacy terms related to such aspects, including but not limited to
          any notice or consent requirements. In particular, a reasonably conspicuous
          audio, visual or other indicator must be displayed to the user as part of
          the Application to indicate that a Recording is taking place.

   3. Local Laws, User Privacy, Location services, Mapping and Payments.

      (a) Applications must comply with all applicable criminal, civil and statutory
          laws and regulations, including those in any jurisdictions in which
          Applications may be delivered.

          In addition, for Applications that use location-based APIs or that collect,
          transmit, maintain, process, share, disclose or otherwise use a user’s
          personal information or data:

          (i)   Applications must comply with all applicable privacy and data
                collection laws and regulations with respect to any collection,
                transmission, maintenance, processing, use, etc. of the user’s
                location data or personal information by the Application.

          (ii)  Applications may not be designed or marketed for the purpose of
                harassing, abusing, stalking, threatening or otherwise violating
                the legal rights (such as the rights of privacy and publicity)
                of others.

          (iii) Applications may not perform any functions or link to any content
                or use any robot, spider, site search or other retrieval application
                or device to scrape, retrieve or index services provided by KAI or
                its licensors, or to collect, disseminate or use information about
                users for any unauthorized purpose.

      (b) For Applications that use location-based APIs, such Applications may not
          be designed or marketed for automatic or autonomous control of vehicles,
          aircraft, or other mechanical devices; dispatch or fleet management; or
          emergency or life-saving purposes. In addition, Applications that offer
          location-based services or functionality must notify and obtain consent
          from an individual before his or her location data is being collected,
          transmitted or otherwise used by the Application.

      (c) For Applications that use location-based APIs for real-time route guidance
          (including, but not limited to, turn-by-turn route guidance and other
          routing that is enabled through the use of a sensor), Licensee must place
          the following notice (or substantially similar) in the end user license
          agreement: LICENSEE USE OF THIS REAL TIME ROUTE GUIDANCE APPLICATION IS
          AT LICENSEE SOLE RISK. LOCATION DATA MAY NOT BE ACCURATE.

      (d) Applications must not disable, override or otherwise interfere with any
          KAI-implemented system alerts, warnings, display panels, consent panels
          and the like, including, but not limited to, those that are intended to
          notify the user that the user’s location data is being collected, transmitted,
          maintained, processed or used, or intended to obtain consent for such use.
          If consent is denied or withdrawn, Applications may not collect, transmit,
          maintain, process or utilize the user’s location data or perform any other
          actions for which the user’s consent has been denied or withdrawn.

      (e) If an Application accesses the Google Mobile Maps (GMM) service through
          the maps API, use of the GMM Service is subject to Google’s Terms of
          Service. If Licensee does not accept such Google Terms of Service, including,
          but not limited to all limitations and restrictions therein Licensee may
          not use the GMM service in the Application. Licensee acknowledges and
          agrees that use of the GMM Service in Applications will constitute the
          Licensee’s acceptance ofsuch Terms of Service.

   4. Content and Materials.

      (a) Any master recordings and musical compositions embodied in Applications
          must be wholly-owned by Licensee or licensed to Licensee on a fully paid-up
          basis and in a manner that will not require the payment of any fees,
          royalties and/or sums by KAI to Licensee or any third party.

      (b) If the Application includes or will include any other content, Licensee
          must either own all such content or have permission from the content
          owner to use it in the Application.

      (c) Applications must not contain any obscene, drugs, gambling, violence,
          alcohol, pornographic, offensive or defamatory content or materials of
          any kind (text, graphics, images, photographs, features, etc.), or other
          content or materials that in KAI’s reasonable judgment may be found
          objectionable.

      (d) Applications must not contain any malware, malicious or harmful code,
          program, or other internal component (e.g. computer viruses, trojan horses,
          “backdoors”) which could damage, destroy, or adversely affect other software,
          firmware, hardware, data, systems, services, or networks.

      (e) If the Application includes any FOSS, Licensee agrees to comply with all
          applicable FOSS licensing terms. Licensee also agrees not to use any FOSS
          or take any action in the development of the Application in such a way
          that would cause the non-FOSS portions of SDK to be subject to any FOSS
          licensing terms or obligations.

   5. Cellular Network.

      If an Application requires or will have access to the cellular network, then
      additionally such Application:

        (a) Must comply with KAI’s best practices and other guidelines on how
            Applications should access and use the cellular network;

        (b) Must not in KAI’s reasonable judgment excessively use or unduly burden
            network capacity or bandwidth;

        (c) May not have Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) functionality using
            the cellular network.

   6. Additional Services.

      From time to time, KAI may provide access to additional services for Licensee
      to use in connection with Applications. Some of these additional services may
      be subject to separate terms and conditions in addition to this Agreement.
      If Licensee elects to use such services, the usage will also be subject to
      those separate terms and conditions.

      KAI may change these Developer Requirements at any time. New or modified
      Developer Requirements will not retroactively apply to Applications already
      in distribution.

      In order to continue using SDK or any services, Licensee must accept and
      agree to the new Developer Requirements. If Licensee does not agree to new
      Developer Requirements, Licensee’s use of SDK and any services can be suspended
      or terminated by KAI.

                              Exhibit B
                        Signing of Application

   Licensee may obtain one or more production digital certificates from KAI, subject
   to a maximum number as reasonably determined by KAI, to be used for the sole
   purpose of signing Application(s) prior to submission of the Application to KAI
   or limited distribution of Application for use on KaiOS Devices.

   In relation to this, Licensee represents and warrants that it:

      (a) will not take any action to interfere with the normal operation of any
          KAI-issued digital certificates or schematics;

      (b) is solely responsible for preventing any unauthorized person from having
          access to digital certificates and corresponding private keys given by
          KAI and it will use the best efforts to safeguard digital certificates
          and corresponding private keys from compromise;

      (c) immediately notify KAI in writing if Licensee has any reason to believe
          there has been a compromise of any of digital certificates or corresponding
          private keys;

      (d) will not provide or transfer KAI-issued digital certificates to any third
          party, nor use digital certificate to sign a third party’s application; and

      (e) will use KAI-issued certificates exclusively for the purpose of signing
          Applications for testing, submission to KAI and/or limited distribution
          for use on KaiOS Devices as contemplated under this Agreement, and only
          in accordance with this Agreement.

   Licensee further represents and warrants to KAI that the licensing terms governing
   the Application, or governing any third party code or FOSS included in the Application,
   will be consistent with and not conflict with the digital signing or content
   protection aspects of the Agreement or any of the terms, conditions or requirements
   of this Agreement.

   In particular, such licensing terms will not purport to require KAI to disclose
   or make available any of the keys, authorization codes, methods, procedures,
   data or other information related to the Security Solution, digital signing or
   digital rights management mechanisms utilized as part of the Agreement.

   If Licensee discovers any such inconsistency or conflict, it shall immediately
   notify KAI of it and will cooperate with KAI to resolve such matter. KAI may
   cease distribution of any affected Applications and refuse to accept any subsequent
   Application submissions from Licensee until such matter is resolved to KAI’s
   reasonable satisfaction.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
